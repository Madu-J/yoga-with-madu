                        therapy techniques
                        now include partner yoga as an intervention. Many find it useful and effective in restoring intimacy and
                        romance.
                        Practicing yoga with a partner or friend can be a fun way to strengthen your relationship.
                        One of the most common couples yoga benefits is to manage mental health. As each yoga pose brings inner peace,
                        concentration, and connection with ones body, it also relieves tension and discomfort.</p>
